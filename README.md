# Web-Scraper-Wuzzuf

## Description:

This is a web scraper for the popular wuzzuf job listing site.
The code is fully written in python and uses the beautiful soup library.
Upon opening the code there are multiple commented segments of the code, some of which are for demo purposes while others could be used to change the time from the "4 Days ago" format to the actual date format.
Upon running the code you will be greated with a simple GUI for the scraper, whereas it asks you for the job position you are searching and how many pages you would like to scrape. (Produces an excel file upon finishing)
There is a simple hard-coded recommendation system coded in as well, whereas once the code finishes scraping it asks for your preferences and produces a different excel sheet with the recommended jobs.

## Note

If you scrape more than 10 pages, the code might take a little while running in order to scrape the number of pages you want. 
I have a gaming laptop and it took 5 minutes to scrape 300 pages.
